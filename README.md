# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

This project dives into the Airbnb dataset to uncover trends and anomalies across pivotal features such as Room Type, Beds, and Neighbourhood. Using Tableau, we visualize the relationship between Price and Review Scores Rating, emphasizing average pricing trends and their correlation with guest reviews. A keen focus on outliers allows us to pinpoint unique market propositions or data discrepancies. The insights derived aim to inform Airbnb hosts and potential investors, presenting a transparent market landscape and assisting in refining their listings for enhanced profitability and guest satisfaction.

## Process

**Airbnb Data Analysis Process:**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Obtain the Airbnb dataset, which comprises listing details from diverse neighborhoods.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Import the dataset.
   - Address missing values through imputation or exclusion.
   - Confirm data type consistency and rectify anomalies.
   - Discard duplicates or irrelevant columns.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Examine fundamental statistics to fathom data distribution.
   - Highlight significant features such as `Room Type`, `Beds`, `Neighbourhood`, `Price`, and `Review Scores Rating`.

4. **Data Visualization with Tableau:**
   - Introduce the refined dataset to Tableau.
   - Craft visualizations elucidating the relationship between categorical and numerical attributes:
     - Bar charts to depict average pricing and review scores segregated by room type, bed count, and neighborhood.
     - Scatter plots to assess the correlation between price and review scores.
     - Visuals specifically aimed at discerning potential outliers.

5. **Analysis & Interpretation:**
   - Scrutinize the visualizations to extract insights:
     - Decode pricing tendencies across varied categories.
     - Gauge the influence of room type, bed quantity, or neighborhood on guest feedback.
     - Identify and probe potential outliers to ascertain their nature â€“ be it authentic unique listings or potential data inaccuracies.

6. **Report & Recommendations:**
   - Chronicle the analytical findings.
   - Propose actionable strategies for Airbnb hosts or investors based on observed patterns and insights.
   - Recommend further examinations or data procurements to amplify market comprehension.

## Results

**Results & Overall Findings:**

During our profound exploration of the Airbnb dataset, we surfaced several pivotal insights:

1. **Pricing Dynamics:**
   - Distinct pricing tendencies emerged across different room categories. Entire homes or apartments generally attracted premium prices in contrast to shared or private rooms. This demarcation underlined the value guests attach to privacy and space.

2. **Review Patterns:**
   - The interrelation between price and review scores offered insights. A loftier price didn't invariably correlate with higher review scores, suggesting guests prioritize facets like hospitality, cleanliness, or distinct experiences alongside or over a listing's luxury.

3. **Neighbourhood Nuances:**
   - Particular neighborhoods were notable for their elevated pricing, possibly owing to factors like prime location, amenities, or historical relevance. Intriguingly, the priciest neighborhoods didn't always garner the highest ratings, hinting at potential areas for enhancement or possible misalignments in price-value offerings.

4. **Bed Count Observations:**
   - Listings boasting more beds typically fetched higher prices, mirroring expansive accommodations. Yet, the correlation between the quantity of beds and review scores was intricate, indicating that accommodation size isn't the sole metric influencing guest contentment.

5. **Outliers & Anomalies:**
   - Our outlier-centric approach spotlighted listings with significantly high prices yet dismal review scores, and vice versa. While some could be ascribed to exclusive offerings or niche sectors, others raised queries about data precision or potential discrepancies in guest anticipations.

**Concluding Remarks:**
The Airbnb marketplace is swayed by a plethora of determinants, from tangible traits like dimensions and locale to intangibles like guest-host rapport or the singularity of an experience. For hosts and investors, the paramount takeaway revolves around the significance of delivering comprehensive value: competitive pricing paired with unparalleled amenities and stellar service.

## Challenges 

**Challenges:**

Throughout this endeavor, we encountered several challenges:

1. **Data Quality:** The Airbnb dataset was riddled with missing values and potential inconsistencies, mandating rigorous cleansing and validation to assure data reliability.

2. **Complex Correlations:** Deciphering the intricate interrelation between price and review scores was challenging. A steeper price didn't consistently align with superior reviews, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of guest anticipations.

3. **Outlier Identification:** Differentiating genuine, unique listings from potential data inaccuracies or outliers necessitated meticulous inspection, especially when outliers appeared to challenge prevailing trends.

4. **Visualization Limitations:** Striking an equilibrium between informative yet uncluttered visualizations in Tableau necessitated iterative fine-tuning, ensuring insights were lucidly and compellingly conveyed.

## Future Goals

**Future Goals:**

1. **Data Expansion:** Seek additional datasets, like seasonal booking tendencies or global Airbnb listings, to augment our analytical breadth.

2. **Predictive Analytics:** Architect machine learning algorithms to forecast listing prices or review scores, aiding hosts in finetuning their offerings.

3. **User Experience (UX) Study:** Embark on qualitative analyses to deepen our grasp of guest predilections and challenges, complementing our quantitative revelations.

4. **Real-time Analysis:** Incorporate real-time data analysis tools to tap into current market
